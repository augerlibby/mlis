         <p> 
            Hello! I am Libby Auger, a 2026 MLIS Graduate from Dominican University in River Forest, Illinois. 
         </p>
         <h2 id="article-title">E-Portfolio</h2>
         <p>
             This e-portfolio highlights competencies, skills, and talents I have developed throughout my MLIS coursework. On this website, you will find my most recent resume, a reflective essay addressing context and rationales for each of my included materials. You will also find 5 learning goals, each with three outcomes and corresponding artifacts that meet each learning outcome.
         </p>

         <p>
         You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
         </p>
         <p>
         You may arrive early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am and ending at 11 am on Saturday. The number on your ticket reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to leave. Please return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss your designated entry time, you will forfeit your place in line. 
         <p>
         We will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets. Once inside, customers may only purchase 12 books. They may then join the remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.
         </p>

         100% of your purchase will help our local library. We charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people you’ll ever find.
