            <h1 id="article-title">What is For Sale?</h1>
         <p> 
         We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more at our monthly sale. These items come from donations from individuals, estates, and companies, along with items that the Palo Alto library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases.
         </p>
         <h2 id="article-title">Location Information</h2>
         <p>
         Our Main Room is along the north driveway, adjacent to the Charleston Shopping Center (see map below). In this room, hardbound books start at $1 each and paperback books at 50 cents each. Please bring your large book donations to this room too.
        </p>
         <p>
         Children's books, music, videos, and toys are in our new room (near the Cubberley track, Pavilion and the Greendell School), where you'll find many items for 50 cents or $1, including picture books, school age fiction and nonfiction, non-English language books, CDs and DVDs, and books for parents and teachers. On Saturday, during the first hour of the sale, please select no more than 12 books at a time, and bring them to the cashiers to hold until you are ready to pay for all your purchases.
         </p>
         <p>
         Bargain books are in rooms K6 and K7, where hardbound books are all $1, paperbacks are 50 cents each, and children's books are just 25 cents. <b>On Sunday, prices in the bargain room are half-off</b>. Save more by purchasing grocery bags for your books for $5 each. <b>Please note that the Children's and Bargain rooms open one hour earlier than the Main room on Saturday.</b>

         <h3 id="article-title">Further Details</h3>
         <p>
         You can purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.
         </p>
         <p>
         You may arrive early on Saturday to ensure an early place in line. We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am and ending at 11 am on Saturday. The number on your ticket reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to leave. Please return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you miss your designated entry time, you will forfeit your place in line. 
         <p>
         We will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered tickets. Once inside, customers may only purchase 12 books. They may then join the remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.
         </p>
         <p>
         100% of your purchase will help our local library. We charge no sales tax and we have the friendliest sales people you’ll ever find.
